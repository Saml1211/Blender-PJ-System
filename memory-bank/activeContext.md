# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the post-MVP phase. The core functionality has been implemented successfully, meeting all the planned milestones for the MVP. The focus now is on refinement, bug fixing, and preparing for the next phase of development.

## Recent Changes
- Successfully completed all MVP milestones:
  - Basic Add-on Structure
  - Projector Object Creation
  - Core Calculations
  - Projection Visualization
  - Model Import Support
  - Multi-Projector Support
- Set up the Memory Bank for project documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Deciding on priority features for the next development phase
- Considering user feedback from initial MVP testing
- Evaluating performance optimizations for multi-projector setups
- Discussing enhanced visualization features for edge blending

## Next Steps
1. **Bug Fixes and Refinements**:
   - Address any reported issues from MVP testing
   - Refine the UI for better usability
   - Optimize code for performance

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Complete user documentation
   - Add more tutorial content
   - Improve in-app help features

3. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Implement enhanced edge blending visualization
   - Develop save/load functionality for projector setups
   - Create detailed projection visualization (brightness, falloff)

4. **Testing**:
   - Conduct broader user testing
   - Test with various environment models
   - Validate accuracy of projections against real-world setups

## Current Challenges
- Edge blending visualization needs more sophisticated rendering
- Multi-projector overlap detection could be optimized for complex setups
- Need to ensure consistent behavior across different Blender versions
