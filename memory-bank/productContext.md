# Product Context

## Problem Statement
AV System Design Engineers need precise tools to plan and visualize projector setups in 3D environments. Traditional 2D CAD tools lack the ability to accurately represent projection cones, screen mapping, and multi-projector interactions in three-dimensional space. This leads to:
- Difficulty in precisely planning projector placements
- Challenges in visualizing how projections will appear in real environments
- Inefficient multi-projector setup planning
- Limited ability to detect potential issues before physical installation

## Solution
The Blender Projection System add-on transforms Blender into a specialized tool for AV professionals by providing:
1. **Accurate Projection Calculations**: Precise bidirectional relationships between throw distance, image width, and throw ratio
2. **Real-time 3D Visualization**: Geometry Nodes-based visualization of projection cones with accurate aspect ratios
3. **Multi-Projector Management**: Collections, duplication, edge blending, and overlap detection for complex setups
4. **Model Import Support**: OBJ/FBX import with scale control and environment tagging
5. **Environment Creation**: Quick room setup tools with positioning controls
6. **Projection Mapping**: Camera-based projection visualization onto model surfaces
7. **Unit System Flexibility**: Support for both metric and imperial measurements

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface**: Accessible to AV professionals who may not be Blender experts
- **Real-time Feedback**: Parameters update projection visualizations immediately
- **Accuracy**: Calculations match real-world projector behaviors
- **Flexibility**: Support for various projector models, environments, and setups
- **Integration**: Works within Blender's ecosystem without disrupting its core functionality
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and tutorials

## Target Users
- **AV System Design Engineers**: Professionals who plan and design projection systems for various venues
- **Installation Technicians**: Staff who need to understand placement and setup requirements
- **Event Planners**: Professionals who need to visualize how projections will appear in venues
- **Educators**: Those teaching projection system design concepts
