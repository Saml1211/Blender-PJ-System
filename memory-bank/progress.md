# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Add-on Structure**: The basic framework is in place with proper registration and UI integration
- **Projector Object Creation**: Users can create and configure projector objects in the scene
- **Parameter Calculations**: Bidirectional relationship between throw distance, image width, and throw ratio works correctly
- **Visualization**: Geometry Nodes-based projection cones visualize with accurate aspect ratios
- **Model Import**: OBJ/FBX import with environment tagging functions as expected
- **Multi-Projector Support**: Collections, duplication, and basic overlap detection are operational

## Current Status
- **MVP Completion**: 100% - All planned MVP milestones have been achieved
- **Documentation**: 70% - User manual needs additional content and examples
- **Testing**: 80% - Core functionality tested, but needs broader user testing
- **Bug Fixes**: Ongoing - Addressing issues as they are reported

## What's Left to Build
- **Enhanced Edge Blending**: More sophisticated visualization of projector overlap areas
- **Save/Load Functionality**: Ability to save and reload projector setups
- **Detailed Projection Visualization**: Advanced visualization including brightness and falloff
- **Interactive Manipulation**: Tools for easier manipulation of projectors in 3D space
- **Ambient Light Simulation**: Visualization of how ambient light affects projection quality
- **Thermal Visualization**: Tools to help with projector placement considering thermal factors
- **VR/AR Integration**: Support for visualizing projections in VR/AR environments

## Known Issues
1. **Edge Blending Visualization**: Current implementation is basic and needs enhancement
2. **Performance with Many Projectors**: Slowdown can occur with numerous projectors in the scene
3. **UI Refinement**: Some UI elements could be more intuitive for non-Blender experts
4. **Projection Mapping**: Camera-based projection visualization needs optimization

## Versioning
- Current Version: 0.1.0 (MVP)
- Next Planned Version: 0.2.0 (Enhanced Edge Blending and Save/Load Functionality)

## Key Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: Approximately 1,956 (across all python files)
- **Number of Operators**: 12 different user operations implemented
- **UI Panels**: 4 main panels with various sub-panels
- **Custom Properties**: 15+ custom properties for projector configuration
