# Project Brief: Blender Projection System

## Project Overview
The Blender Projection System is a comprehensive Blender add-on designed for AV System Design Engineers to accurately calculate, visualize, and plan projector setups in 3D environments. It provides precise bidirectional calculations, real-time 3D visualization, and multi-projector management capabilities.

## Core Goals
- Enable accurate projection calculations with bidirectional relationships
- Provide real-time 3D visualization of projection cones
- Support multi-projector setups with management features
- Allow model import with scale control
- Facilitate environment creation with quick room setup tools
- Enable projection mapping onto model surfaces
- Support both metric and imperial units

## MVP Status
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) has been successfully completed with the following milestones implemented:
1. Basic Add-on Structure: Core framework, UI panel, unit toggle
2. Projector Object Creation: Object hierarchy, custom properties, operators
3. Core Calculations: Bidirectional parameter linking
4. Projection Visualization: Geometry Nodes cone visualization with drivers
5. Model Import: OBJ/FBX import with environment tagging
6. Multi-Projector Support: Collections, duplication, overlap detection

## Project Scope
- Target Users: AV System Design Engineers
- Blender Version: 4.2+
- Programming Language: Python 3.10+ (included with Blender)
- License: MIT

## Future Roadmap
- Enhanced edge blending visualization
- Save/load functionality
- Detailed projection visualization (brightness, falloff)
- Interactive manipulation tools
- Ambient light simulation
- Thermal visualization
- VR/AR integration
